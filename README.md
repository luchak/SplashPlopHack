SplashPlopHack
==============

SplashPlopHack is a 2D liquid simulation framework for iOS. It's based on Macklin and Mueller 2013, "Position Based Fluids".

There's an included demo app in the DripDrop directory, although I'd prefer to call it Water Words. This demonstrates liquid rendering using GLSL, following Zhu and Bridson 2005, "Animating Sand as a Fluid". It also demonstrates accelerometer interaction and other ways to play with your new liquid.

Some constant tuning may be necessary.
